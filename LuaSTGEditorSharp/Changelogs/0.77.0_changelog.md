## LuaSTG Editor Sharp X - 0.77.0
## Features

* Support for compilation in LuaSTG Evo.
* Added the project meta file to the auto backup.

## Nodes

* Added the alignment window to the format input on the RenderTTF node.

## Changes

* Re-arranged a lot of code output of nodes (correct indentation and new lines).
* Changed some nodes descriptions.
* Removed the "beta" attribute for Sub support.
* Made the "Set/Wait for signal", "Add chargeball" and "Set Pace" not trigger THlib compat. errors for Evo and Sub.

## Fixes

* Fixed display errors in all main Input Windows.
* Fixed a problem with selecting the arrow on the nodes attributes' dropdowns (the mouse wouldn't select it).
* Fixed comment double new-line code output.
* The editor won't throw an error when the LuaSTG executable path isn't the same as the target compile version.
* Replaced font file paths with "/" instead of "\\" in order to improve other platforms' compatibility.
