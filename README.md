**LuaSTG Editor Sharp X** is a *code generator* for the LuaSTG engine, based on the *THlib* library. It is based on and forked from [**czh098tom**](https://github.com/czh098tom)'s original [**Editor Sharp**](https://github.com/czh098tom/LuaSTG-Editor-Sharp).

<h3>Usage</h3>
to be written

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
The editor is designed to fit many variants of the LuaSTG engine. New versions can be added within the source via a plugin system, which can change runtime arguments between versions.

:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
:heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :hourglass: (next release) | As long as THlib is present

</div>

Depending on the THlib you're using, some of the node functions may not be available. Some of these cases are handled by the editor, displaying a warning about the node not working unless your codebase supports it. This warning can be disabled in the settings.

<h3>Features</h3>

As a code generator, the editor can virtually handle any type of code you'd likely do in the usual IDE but with a friendly GUI, **allowing direct coding via code nodes** as well. Here are some creations that can be done natively without extra coding needed, as well as editor features.

<div align="center">
  
Creation | System
:---: | :---: 
Boss fights | Light/Dark editor themes
Stage sections | Automatic engine version detection
Players | Folder/Zip packing
3D Backgrounds | Logging/debug window (Sub only)
Advanced dialog handling | Custom node creation (experimental)
Post-effect and particles | Node marketplace (in development)
Advanced object manipulation | Automatic updates
Game data handling | Discord Rich Presence
Audio control | Auto-saves
Advanced rendering | Project inclusion

</div>

Of course, that's just a fraction of all the things the editor is capable of.

LuaSTG Editor Sharp X is an unoffical LuaSTG Editor.
The aim of LuaSTG Editor Sharp X is to develop an user-friendly, high extensive editor with higher efficiency.
The user interface is similar to the offical one, so it's easy to master if the user is familiar with the old one.
However, old projects are not supported due to different file format.
