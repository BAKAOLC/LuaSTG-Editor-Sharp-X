Depending on the THlib you're using, some of the node functions may not be available. Some of these cases are handled by the editor, displaying a warning about the node not working unless your codebase supports it. This warning can be disabled in the settings.

LuaSTG Editor Sharp X is an unoffical LuaSTG Editor.
The aim of LuaSTG Editor Sharp X is to develop an user-friendly, high extensive editor with higher efficiency.
The user interface is similar to the offical one, so it's easy to master if the user is familiar with the old one.
However, old projects are not supported due to different file format.
